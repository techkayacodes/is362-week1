IS 362 Assignment 1 – SQL and Tableau (Review)


Part 1. SQL and NULLs
Please use the tables in the flights database. Your
deliverable should include the SQL queries that you write in
support of your conclusions. You may use multiple queries to
answer questions.
1. How many airplanes have listed speeds? What is the
minimum listed speed and the maximum listed speed?
2. What is the total distance flown by all of the planes in
January 2013? What is the total distance flown by all of
the planes in January 2013 where the tailnum is
missing?
3. What is the total distance flown for all planes on July 5,
2013 grouped by aircraft manufacturer? Write this
statement first using an INNER JOIN, then using a LEFT
OUTER JOIN. How do your results compare?
4. Write and answer at least one question of your own
choosing that joins information from at least three of
the tables in the flights database

Part 2. Comparing Performance in Tableau
Your task is to use Tableau to compare flight performance within a category for 2013. For example, you could show
average monthly departure delay across the three New York airports. You may use this example, but you’re strongly
encouraged to come up with your own example that you might find more interesting

Your deliverables should be posted in GitHub, with a link to your GitHub repository in your assignment submission.
1. The SQL script used to pull data into a .CSV file.
2. The Tableau workbook (or better, a link to your Tableau Public workbook)
